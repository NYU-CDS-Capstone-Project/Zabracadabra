# Zabracadabra
capstone project

# Team name: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Zabracadabra

# Team members:
 - **Yurui Mu**: Yurui received her B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at SUNY Stony Brook. And she is now a second year full-time graduate student at NYU Center for Data Science. She has past research experience at National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China. She has also worked as intern at MENUSIFU Inc. as data analyst. Having taken Machine Learning, Big Data, Deep Learning, Text As Data courses at CDS, she is interested in applications of machine learning in various fields of study.
 
 - **Wenqing Zhu**: Wenqing is also a second-year Data Science student at New York University. She has attained her B.A. degree in Mathematics and Economics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She has taken classes such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Fundamentals of Algorithms for the past year. For coding, Wenqing has a programming background in Python and MapReduce.

# Reason for teaming up:
 - We share same interest in working on natural language processing and the applications of machine learning . And we want to apply it in solving real world problems. 

# Top 4 project choices:
 - **Newspaper Coverage Data**: This project has two major research questions. The first question concerns how newspaper coverage has changed over time. The second question is about what newspaper coverage can tell us about the demand for information. The scope of project will be focused on tackling concrete question.
 - **NYU Langone Medical Center (with Narges Razavian)**: This project is on machine learning models on time series patient data to predict health outcomes. Some concrete initiatives include predict unidiagnosed diseases from electronic health records and medical notes, back-propagation or attention based modeks for visualization of machine learning model decisions per instance.
 - **NYUMC Population Health(with Judy Zhong)**: Our project proposes to use cutting edge deep learning methods to analyze the longitudinal data to predict CVD and disability development in PD/DM patients over time. These analyses will lead to practical population based methods to stratify people with DM for their individual risks of CVD and disability, helping to individualize care.
 - **Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories**: Classify lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and skin cancers and visualize features learned by models.
